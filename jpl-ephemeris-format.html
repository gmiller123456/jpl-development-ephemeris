<h1>Format of the JPL Ephemeris Files</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The JPL Development Ephemeris provide high quality, accurate data on the positions of the planets, the moon, and sometimes a few other variables.  Writing software to
use the JPL files is not difficult.  Unfortunately the documentation is pretty lacking, scattered, and mostly relies on reading the source code of reference implementations.
Having looked at the reference implementations, I'm pretty convinced that the authors are better astronomers than they are programmers.  I'm not here to judge, I'm certainly
a much better programmer than I am an astronomer.  I'm hoping with this article I can help bridge the gap, and explain how to use the JPL ephemeris data in terms that are easier
for programmers to follow who might not be as informed on astronomy.</p>

<p>If you've looked at some of the implementations provided by NASA, or the <a href="https://www.projectpluto.com/jpl_eph.htm">Project Pluto</a> implementations, it might look like
it's an impossibly hard task to grapple.  But the reality is that these are optimised implementations, designed to work with multiple ephemeris versions, and are written in
pretty old languages that lack features that make code easier to understand (even if they run slower).  In reality, in most of these implementations, only about 10-30 lines of
code actual deal with calculating the position (or velocity) of the planets.  Most of the rest of the code is dealing with edge cases for dealing with multiple versions,
memory management, and finding the right coefficients to finally pass to the computation function.</p>

<p>If you're willing to forego the flexibility of being able to process ephemeris files you've never seen before, then writing a program to compute all of the series in a JPL
ephemeris version can be done in about 100 lines of code in pretty much any modern language.  In fact, if you were to rearrange the JPL ephemeris files
into a format which is easier to parse, you could likely get that down to 10 to 20 lines of code.  The point I'm trying to make here, is that it's
the file format that is complicated, not the actual computation of positions.</p>


<h2>Why Write Your Own (Do We Really Need Another Ephemeris Generator)?</h2>

<p>Probably the number one reason to write your own software, specific to your needs, is that you won't be locked in to using the format JPL provides the ephemeris data in.  As
you'll see below, much of the data is independent of each other.  And, if you're only interested in data on the Sun, Earth, and Moon, you can extract that data into your
own files, considerably reducing the size of the files you have to work with.</p>

<p>Another reason is most of the implementations recommended by the JPL are written in C, which is great if speed is your only concern. But modern computing environments aren't
very friendly to the C ecosystem.  A web browser won't let you run a C application at all, but is very likely the most widely used platform for applications.  Platforms like
Android will let you run C, but providing binaries for every type of device is practically impossible.  Other systems, like microcontrollers, have no concept of file systems.</p>

<p>So, there's a lot of room to grow.</p>

<h2>Header Files</h2>

Have a look at the <a href="header.405">DE 405 header file</a>.  Most of the data you see here will not be used by us, we're primarily interested in only a few key parts
highlighted and explained below.

<h3>NCOEFF</h3>
When we look at the ASCII data files, you'll noticed that it is broken up into blocks, all of which are a fixed length.  The value following NCOEFF= is the count of numbers in this block.  Though, that is parly a lie, as some of the ephemeris data files are padded with zeros.  For example, for DE 405, each block has an extra two zeros, so the
actual length of the block is 1020 numbers, though the last two numbers will never be used.

<h3>GROUP 1030</h3>
<p>The first two numbers here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Julian Days</a>.  They are the earliest, and latest dates that the ephemeris can generate
data for.  You'll notice that GROUP 1010, just above GROUP 1030 has the same data, and with their respective Gregorian Calendar dates listed along side.  But if you're
parsing the file automatically, you'll likely find GROUP 1030 easier to parse.</p>
<p>The last number, which is 32 in this case, is the total number of days a given block contains data for.  As I said above, each file is broken up into many blocks, and each
block is only good for a set number of days.  You'll use this later to compute an offset into the full list of data to find the right coefficients.
</p>

<h3>GROUP 1050</h3>
<p>This is the most complicated part of the data, and will be explained in more detail when we actually look at the data files.  But the short version is that each column here
represents a planet (or some other data element).  The oder is consistent across all of the ephemeris versions.  The order is:

<span class=footnote>SSB = Solar System Barycenter</span>

</p>
<p>You'll notice that not all ephemeris versions contain data for every data element.  For example DE405 (above) does not have data for Lunar Mantle Velocity, nor TT-TDB.
and DE432 (below) does not have data for Nutations, Mantle Velocity, nor TT-TDB.  Exactly how each ephemeris version expresses the fact that they lack data for a
certain element is somewhat variable.  You'll notice that DE405 just lacks those columns, where DE432 has indicated 0 for the number of coefficients.  Otherwise, you'll
note that the numbers are pretty much the same between DE405 and DE432.</p>

		<li>The number of subintervals</li>
	</ul>
<p>Not included here, but also important is the number of properties for each series.  This information you have to infer by the type of series.  Though you could compute
	it by looking at where the next series starts (or for the last series, the length of a block).  Each planet has three properties (X, Y, and Z). Nutations have two
	properties (dpsi, deps).  Librations have three (phi, theta, psi).  Mantel velocity has three (omega x, omega y, omega z).  And TT-TDB has just one.  This data is
included in the table with names above.</p>

<h3>What About the Earth?!?</h3>
If you were paying attention, you'd have noticed that there's no data for computing the position of the Earth.  Instead we get data for both the Earth-Moon Barycenter, and
a geocentric position for the Moon.  But, using those two quantities, we can compute the position of the Earth:</p>
<pre style="border:solid">
<b>Earth=EMB-Moon/(1+earthMoonMassRatio)</b>
</pre>
<p>  So, anytime you need
tht position of the Earth, you must first compute the EMB and Moon positions, then use those positions in the equation above.  The earthMoonMassRatio
value comes from the header file, and is highlighted above (0.813005600000000044D+02).


<h2>ASCII Files</h2>

JPL provides ASCII versions of the ephemeris files, and binary versions of some of them, some in little-endian and some in big-endian format.  For
the purposes of this article I will deal only with the ASCII format.  The binary format is pretty similar once you get past the header.  As I said
above, one of the biggest advantages to writing your own ephemeris generator is that you're not locked in to using the JPL formatted files.  Converting
them to binary can speed up processing significantly, and if that's important to your application, you can probably come up with a more appropriate
binary format than the JPL version.  For that reason, I won't go into the binary format any further.

<h3>Files</h3>
Each ephemeris version has files named slightly differently, mostly based on how many years of data each file contains.  The basic format of
the filename is:
ASC[P/M][Year].[Version]

Where [P/M] stand for "plus" or "minus".  It is "M" for negative years in the Gregorian Calendar, and "P" otherwise.  [Year] is the first year the
file has data for.  And [Version] is the version of the ephemeris it was generated for.

The numbers in the files are formatted as exponentials, with a D denoting the exponent.  You will need to replace this D with an E in order for it
to parse correctly in most programming languages.

<h3>Blocks<h3>
If you open up the <a href="ascp2020.405">ascp2020.405</a> file as an example.  The first thing you'll notice is that it's broken up into blocks,
with each block starting with two integers on a line, followed by a list of floating point numbers.  The two integers are the block number, and
the number of coefficients the block contains.  The number of coefficients, is the same as NCOEFF from the header file.  And remember that
the number of coefficients isn't always equal to the actual count of numbers.  For example the DE405 blocks are always padded with two zeros, so there
are actually 1020 numbers in each block.  Other ephemeris versions will have different padding standards.

<h3>Valid dates</h3>
The first two numbers of each block (for every ephemeris version) are the Julian Days for which the block is valid.  For example, the first block in the
ascp2020.405 file is valid from 2458832.5 to 2458864.5.

<h3>Series</h3>
The not-so obvious breakdown of the coefficients starts here.  This is where you need the data from "GROUP 1050" given in the header file, as well
as the knowledge of how many components each series has (given in Table 1 above).  Using Mercury as an example, it has a starting offset of "3" (line 1 of GROUP 1050), so
its coefficients start with -0.468225142464447618D+08.

<h3>Components</h3>
Line 2 of GROUP 1050 shows how many coefficients each component has, for Mercury that's 14.  We know from Table 1 that Mercury has three components: X, Y and Z.

Using the first block of ascp2020.405 as an example, for the first subinterval (explained in the next section) the Mercury's coefficients for X, Y, and Z are:

X:-0.468225142464447618D+08  0.855287673857185431D+07  0.612484375662173959D+06 -0.271197032404459242D+05

  0.371477546608301747D-08 -0.861673297708620472D-10

<h3>Subintervals</h3>
Line 3 of GROUP 1050 is the number of subintervals a series has in each block.  As explained in the "Valid Dates" section, each block has data for only
a specific period of time (usually 32 days).  Some of the planets, like Mercury, have to be divided into even smaller sections.  We see that from line
3, in the first colum of GROUP 1050, that Mercury is divided into 4 subintervals.  This means that all of the coefficients for all of the components are
included 4 times, each set valid only for 1/4th the interval in which the entire block is valid for.

Using Mercury and the first block of ascp2020.405 as an example.  It has 4 subintervals, the block is valid for 32 days, so each subinterval for
Mercury is valid for 8 days.  So, 2458832.5 is the start of the first subinterval, and 2458840.5 is the start of the second subinterval, and so on.  So,
if we were asked to compute the position of Mercury on JD=2458850.5, we would see that date falls in the third subinterval (subinterval 2 if counting the
first as 0).  We would then compute:

subinterval=floor( (JD-blockStartDate)/lengthOfSubinterval )
subinterval=floor( (2458850.5 - 2458832.5)/8)
subinterval=floor( 2.25 )
subinterval=2

offset=subinterval*numberOfCoefficients*numberOfProperties+seriesStartOffset
offset=2 * 14 * 3 + 3 = 87

So we would start with the 87th number in the list of floats, and take the X, Y, and Z coefficients from there.  Remember that if you're using arrays,
most languages start indexes with 0, so the 87th number is array index 86.

<h2>Computing the Chebyshev Polynomial</h2>

All that work just to find a handful of numbers we want to multiply against.  The good news is the JPL has already done all of the hard work from
here, there's just a couple of more steps to get the position.

<h3>Normalize the Julian Date to the Range -1 to +1</h3>

The Chebyshev polynomials don't use Julian Days for computation, instead they require a number from -1 to +1.  -1 would represent the time of the beginning
of a subinterval, and +1 represents the end.  So we have to scale our Julian Day based on the start and end times of the subinterval.  It's important to
remember to use the times for which the <b>subinterval</b> is valid, not the entire block.  So we must first compute the valid range for the subinterval.
Using the example of Mercury and JD=2458850.5 from above.

validStart= blockStart + subinterval * lengthOfSubinterval = 2458848.5
validEnd= validStart + lengthOfSubinterval = 2458856.5

In order to preserve maximum accuracy of the floating point JD, it is necessary to subtract off the validStart before normalization:

temp = JD - validStart
temp = 2458850.5 - 2458848.5 = 2.0

You may have noticed that many programs use a two part JD in order to increase the accuracy of the JD.  In all previous instances where we used the JD,
you can just add the two parts together without loss of accuracy.  It is here at this step where in makes a difference.

[alternate two part JD method]
temp = JDpart1 - validStart + JDpart2

Now compute the normalized time variable which will be used in the Chebyshev polynomial:

x = temp / lengthOfSubinterval * 2.0 - 1.0
x = 2.0 / 8.0 * 2.0 - 1.0
x = -0.5

<h3>Computing the Position</h3>

Computing the Chebyshev polynomial involves expanding the polynomial using the algorithm below.  This is equation 14.20 from the Explanatory Supplement to
the Astronomical Almanac, or alternatively presented on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Wikipedia Page</a>:

<pre>
T(0) = 1
T(1) = x
T(n) = 2 * x * T(n-1) - T(n-2)
</pre>

Where n is the number of coefficients for the property we're computing.

Continuing our example of computing the position of Mercury for JD=2458850.5.  We have x = -0.5 from above, and 14 coefficients, so n = 14.  Note
we're using array indexes starting at 0, so n will actually stop at 13.
