Format of header of binary JPL Development Ephemeris file

The header contains some unknown/inferred values which means existing programs likely will
not be able to read new files which add new planets/series.

The referces to things like "Group 1010" are references to portions of the ASCII header and
are explained in detail at celestialprogramming.com.

The overall format of the header is 2 times the blocksize.  The blocksize isn't in the header
and must be computed after reading the first half of the header using the inferred property
numbers in Table 2, or looked up from Table 3 using the DE version.  But, for the versions
ending in "t", the "t" does no appear in the header, so you will need a different method of
identifying those versions' block sizes.  Computing the block size always works for all
existing versions.  Refer to the source code findRecLength() function for the exact details.

The first half of the header is from 0 - blocksize.  It contains all but the last two fields
listed in Table 1.  The second half of the header goes from blocksize - 2*blocksize, and
contains all of the constants from group 1041.

The "undefined" portions of the file should be set to null, but some asc2eph programs do not
clear the memory of these portions, and some binary files floating around do have leaked
personal information in these areas.  So you cannot count on these to be null, though many
programs do properly set them to null.  If they were set to null, it'd be possible to infer
the blocksize for compatibility with newer DE versions, but even the files distributed by
NASA have extranious information in these areas.

s - string
l - 32 bit integer (long)
d - 64 bit floating point (double)

2844-2855    array of l       1 array of 3 Ints.  Represents column 13 of Group 1050
2856-var     array of s       If more than 400 constants, 400-constantCount constant names.
var-var      array of l       After (400-constantCount)*6, 2 arrays of 3 ints.  Represents cols 14,15 of Group 1050
var-block    undefined        Undefined until end of block size
block+1-var  d                All values for constants
var-2*block  d                Undefined to end of block size

*Each of the three entries in the array represent rows 1-3 of group 1050

"block" is the computed block size using the inferred number of properties for each variable
in Table 2.
