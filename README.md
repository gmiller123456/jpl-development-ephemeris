Implementations in various langauges to compute the positions of planets (and other properties) from the
JPL Development Ephemeris.

The ASCII Directory contains implementations which work with the ASCII file distributions.  The Binary
directory contains implemenations which work with the binary files generated from the ASCII versions,
and a utility to perform the conversion.

The BinaryHeaderFormat.txt contains a description of the binary header, but requires knowledge of
the ASCII header format described at http://www.celestialprogramming.com/.
